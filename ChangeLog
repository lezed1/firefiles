version 2.07:
	* fix for dual-headed display bug.  Thanks to an anonymous tip for finding
	this.
	* new FC4 spec courtesy of Simon Roberts.

version 2.06:
    * fixed a bug with mode probalities where every part was off by 1.
    * added a French resource.rc (resource.rc.french).  Rename it if you're
    French.  Thanks to Stephane Sudre for this and the Mac OS X port.

version 2.05:
    * put back autoconf GLX detection into configure.ac (don't know how that
    disappeared).
    * code cleanup: separated GLCanvas into CanvasGLX and CanvasSDL for the
    different backends.

version 2.04:
    * whoops: I broke it pretty good.  This release fixes it
    * small addition: fixed jaggy lines caused when fireflies runs on a slow
    or busy machine.

version 2.03:
    * added a default "do nothing" mode with hardcoded probability 10 (so you
    can make modes less frequent)
    * added small shell script to add a fireflies entry to your xscreensaver
    config file.
    * new package support: Redhat
    * new package support: Debian (much thanks to Serge Koenigsmann
    <serge@koenigsmann.de>)
    * MesaGL support

version 2.02:
    * fixed xscreensaver support which 2.01 broke

version 2.01:
    * changed how number of flies and baits work: you now specify a minimum
    and maximum for each, so that things don't get out of control when
    adding/killing baits and flies.
    * -fast_forward option
    * -fps (frames per second) option
    * new Faded swarm mode: colors get lighter
    * added short delays between frames so as not to waste ALL your CPU
    * some cool new "features" in the SDL standalone program
    * fixed mode probabilities: made fly birth/kill and swarm merge/split
    equally likely, so you don't end up with a million flies in 1 swarm after
    a few hours.
    * uses autoconf to automatically determine what system you're compiling on,
    and whether you have SDL, glX, etc
    * option parsing: uses argp instead of getopt (not that you will notice,
    it just makes me feel better about myself)
    * put mode functions in their own file

version 2.0: Fri Feb 21, 2003
    * new motion algorithm: the fireflies chase after baits that fly
    around, and freely switch who they're chasing
    * modes: swarms go through mode changes, such as speeding up, stopping
    for a breather, and going psychadelic. The overall scene also undergoes
    mode changes, such as the wind picking up, creation/deletion of new
    flies/baits, and an... interesting.. matrix mode
    * new diamond particle shape
    * sporting a nifty (read: ugly) xscreensaver configuration interface
    file (Linux only)

version 1.02: Thu Feb 13, 2003
    * ported to windows (using MinGW)
    * made it a windows screensaver! even made a config box!
    * added a -fullscreen option
    * fixed blending

version 1.01: Sun Feb 10, 2003
    * added wind to blow the tails around
    * made it compatible with xscreensaver!
    * removed dependence on GLUT (incidentally, making it slightly faster)

version 1.0: Sun Feb 10, 2003
    * First release

began: Sun Jan 26, 2003
